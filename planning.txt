Things to do for the musichistory branch version6redux.

Goals -

1. To link up my firebase with the app using angularfire.

2. To use angularfire to display things on the page.

Planning and checklist -

√	1. Install firebase and angularfire and link them to the index (firebase first, then angularfire).
	
√	2. Set up a module with the proper dependencies and a controller for referencing firebase.

√	3. Adjust the HTML and routing so that they're binding to the right controller.

√	4. Make sure everything works and is lint free.

For the next part -

	5. Set up a module for adding songs to firebase.

	6. Set up a module for filtering and displaying what's in the dropdowns.
